SOLVING PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN

Join TralahTek as we build:
- open source software
- scalable data pipelines
- modern web UIs
- Real-time Payment systems
- Intelligent IOT smart homes

## Technology
* Data Pipelines
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning
We use the infrastructure of AWS,to scale very quickly in new markets, and to develop products whole lot faster.
This in turn allows our engineers to divert most of their attention towards building products and helping businesses grow.

## Teams

* Infrastructure
The Infrastructure team collaborates closely with Data Science to ensure the rest of
the engineering teams get real-time data without any issues.
They are respomsible for building the infrastructure that allows data science and other
teams to do their work efficiently

* Data Science
This team is constantly changing models and the algorithm to account for new incoming data. The work done is high-math based and has a huge scale. The first step of solving a problem is framing it—with this group, the problem is always changing. These problems are typically fun and interesting in nature.

* Applications
The Applications team builds products for both internal and external users—essentially every user-facing product TralahTek produces. They are the only group that is primarily focused on user interaction. This team collaborates with designers and product managers to ensure that everything that is built fits our users’ needs.

* Business Intelligence (BI)
BI is responsible for measuring how well TralahTek is performing for clients. This group ensures that clients have access to high-impact ad inventories. Additionally, the team helps incubate new products by measuring their effectiveness. They analyze the most interesting data sets and come up with insights that optimize our algorithm—curious minds are always welcomed.

* Solutions Engineering
Solutions engineers are the most client-facing team. They work closely with sales (with on boarding and post-launch issues) and customers’ implication teams to solve wide-ranging issues—covering all verticals. They’re time is split between writing code and interacting with customers. This group contains members with very diverse set of backgrounds and is the only team that codes in different techs.
